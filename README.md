# kinopoisk_sentiment
This is a comparison of ML-models and a transformer-model build to determine sentiment of movie reviews in Russian Language.

The comparative study consits of two parts:
1. Classical machine learning algorithms (Multinomial Naive Bayes, C-Support Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, CatBoost)
2. Bert-like model (RuBert)

The models were trained on Kinopoisk movie reviews dataset (TOP250 & BOTTOM100 rank lists)
